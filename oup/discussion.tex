\section{Discussion}

We were unable to definitively say whether our method improved on Salmon. The output of using the average of the EM and VBEM results produced similar results to just EM or VBEM by themselves. A lower prior, $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-1}$, resulted in similar results to EM while priors greater than $10^0$ resulted in similar results to VBEM. At no point does it appear that using the average of both methods significantly improved the output, but it also did not significantly harm the results. This is likely attributed to our method of combining EM and VBEM. Even though we did not find conclusive results, there are next steps to further this work.
