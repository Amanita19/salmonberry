\section{Discussion}

In the current timeframe, we were unable to expand on our project but in future work, we would like to expand upon ways to best combine the results of the EM and VBEM algorithms. Currently we are only taking the mean of the two results. However, we would also like to experiment with the weighted average or the Bayesian model average of these two algorithms also taking into account various prior sizes. We hypothesize that this would further improve Salmonâ€™s results. \cite{doi:10.1177/2515245919898657}


We would also like to verify the time it takes to run our combined approach. We would like to verify that running this approach will not greatly impact the runtime of Salmon. While we expect the runtime to increase; however, we would like to verify that it is not detrimental to the use of Salmon. 

In future work, it will be beneficial to get a measure of uncertainty when running our trials. We were unable to run this during our initial experiments. However, we would like to know if there is a level of uncertainty with our results when we use the average of the EM and VBEM algorithms. We would like to know if this uncertainty increases or decreases, and if so, is the change in uncertainty significantly. Salmon already supports this analysis through the use of a flag.
