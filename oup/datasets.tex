\subsection{Datasets}
We used synthetic datasets in the same form as \cite{patro_salmon_2017}. 
We generated our synthetic data using polyester 1.16.0 and alpine version 1.6.0. 
[citation] There was ground truth available for this dataset. We additionally used real human datasets. 
We used a dataset consisting of NK cells, T cells, and tumor from matched soft tissue sarcoma and peripheral 
blood collected from soft tissue sarcomas patients who had undergone surgery. 
[citation] We also utilized the human transcriptome reference: Homo sapiens GRCh38 cDNA sequence. 
These were gene models built from alignments of the human proteome and alignments of human cDNAs. [citation]
