\section{Experiment}

We began by editing Salmon’s source code. We wrote a bash script that downloaded our datasets. We also had a script that ran our samples using EM, VBEM, and a combination of the VBEM and EM algorithms. 
First we ran unaltered Salmon using EM and VBEM. For each pass that used VBEM, we specified a prior 10-5 through 101. 
	We then ran the same datasets using the average of both the EM and VBEM algorithms. We ran the EM and VBEM algorithms on the same data, producing an array. FOr each index in this array, the data was averaged and inserted into a new array that was used the final calculations. We again used priors of 10-5 through 101 when considering the VBEM algorithm. 
	We ran this on [Nathalie’s laptop]
	Finally, we compared the results of these passes using the ground truth of the synthetic data. We calculate the MARD of our results. We also calculated the Spearman Correlation and a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test.
