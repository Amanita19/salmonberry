	abstract = {PURPOSE: Clinical successes using current T-cell based immunotherapies have been limited in soft tissue sarcomas (STS), while pre-clinical studies have shown evidence of natural killer (NK) cell activity. Since tumor immune infiltration, especially tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, is associated with improved survival in most solid tumors, we sought to evaluate the gene expression profile of tumor and blood NK and T cells, as well as tumor cells, with the goal of identifying potential novel immune targets in STS.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we isolated blood and tumor-infiltrating CD3-CD56+ NK and CD3+ T cells and CD45- viable tumor cells from STS patients undergoing surgery. We then evaluated differential gene expression (DGE) of these purified populations with RNA sequencing analysis. To evaluate survival differences and validate primary DGE results, we also queried The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to compare outcomes stratified by bulk gene expression.
RESULTS: Sorted intra-tumoral CD3+ T cells showed significant upregulation of established activating (CD137) and inhibitory genes (TIM-3) compared to circulating T cells. In contrast, intra-tumoral NK cells did not exhibit upregulation of canonical cytotoxic genes (IFNG, GZMB), but rather significant DGE in mitogen signaling (DUSP4) and metabolic function (SMPD3, SLC7A5). Tumors with higher NK and T cell infiltration exhibited significantly increased expression of the pro-inflammatory receptor TLR4 in sorted CD45- tumor cells. TCGA analysis revealed that tumors with high TLR4 expression (P = 0.03) and low expression of STMN1 involved in microtubule polymerization (P {\textless} 0.001) were associated with significantly improved survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Unlike T cells, which demonstrate significant DGE consistent with upregulation of both activating and inhibiting receptors in tumor-infiltrating subsets, NK cells appear to have more stable gene expression between blood and tumor subsets, with alterations restricted primarily to metabolic pathways. Increased immune cell infiltration and improved survival were positively correlated with TLR4 expression and inversely correlated with STMN1 expression within tumors, suggesting possible novel therapeutic targets for immunotherapy in STS.},

Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model averaging (BMA)provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples.In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample predictive performance.

The entire pipeline is fast, benefiting from inference steps by Salmon to quantify expression at the transcript level. The workflow includes live, runnable code chunks for analysis using DRIMSeq and DEXSeq, as well as for performing two-stage testing of DTU using the stageR package, a statistical framework to screen at the gene level and then confirm which transcripts within the significant genes show evidence of DTU.

	abstract = {We consider the problem of model selection and accounting for model uncertainty in high-dimensional contingency tables, motivated by expert system applications. The approach most used currently is a stepwise strategy guided by tests based on approximate asymptotic P values leading to the selection of a single model; inference is then conditional on the selected model. The sampling properties of such a strategy are complex, and the failure to take account of model uncertainty leads to underestimation of uncertainty about quantities of interest. In principle, a panacea is provided by the standard Bayesian formalism that averages the posterior distributions of the quantity of interest under each of the models, weighted by their posterior model probabilities. Furthermore, this approach is optimal in the sense of maximizing predictive ability. But this has not been used in practice, because computing the posterior model probabilities is hard and the number of models is very large (often greater than 1011). We argue that the standard Bayesian formalism is unsatisfactory and propose an alternative Bayesian approach that, we contend, takes full account of the true model uncertainty by averaging over a much smaller set of models. An efficient search algorithm is developed for finding these models. We consider two classes of graphical models that arise in expert systems: the recursive causal models and the decomposable log-linear models. For each of these, we develop efficient ways of computing exact Bayes factors and hence posterior model probabilities. For the decomposable log-linear models, this is based on properties of chordal graphs and hyper-Markov prior distributions and the resultant calculations can be carried out locally. The end product is an overall strategy for model selection and accounting for model uncertainty that searches efficiently through the very large classes of models involved. Three examples are given. The first two concern data sets that have been analyzed by several authors in the context of model selection. The third addresses a urological diagnostic problem. In each example, our model averaging approach provides better out-of-sample predictive performance than any single model that might reasonably have been selected.},

	abstract = { Many statistical scenarios initially involve several candidate models that describe the data-generating process. Analysis often proceeds by first selecting the best model according to some criterion and then learning about the parameters of this selected model. Crucially, however, in this approach the parameter estimates are conditioned on the selected model, and any uncertainty about the model-selection process is ignored. An alternative is to learn the parameters for all candidate models and then combine the estimates according to the posterior probabilities of the associated models. This approach is known as Bayesian model averaging (BMA). BMA has several important advantages over all-or-none selection methods, but has been used only sparingly in the social sciences. In this conceptual introduction, we explain the principles of BMA, describe its advantages over all-or-none model selection, and showcase its utility in three examples: analysis of covariance, meta-analysis, and network analysis. }
