	abstract = {PURPOSE: Clinical successes using current T-cell based immunotherapies have been limited in soft tissue sarcomas (STS), while pre-clinical studies have shown evidence of natural killer (NK) cell activity. Since tumor immune infiltration, especially tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, is associated with improved survival in most solid tumors, we sought to evaluate the gene expression profile of tumor and blood NK and T cells, as well as tumor cells, with the goal of identifying potential novel immune targets in STS.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we isolated blood and tumor-infiltrating CD3-CD56+ NK and CD3+ T cells and CD45- viable tumor cells from STS patients undergoing surgery. We then evaluated differential gene expression (DGE) of these purified populations with RNA sequencing analysis. To evaluate survival differences and validate primary DGE results, we also queried The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to compare outcomes stratified by bulk gene expression.
RESULTS: Sorted intra-tumoral CD3+ T cells showed significant upregulation of established activating (CD137) and inhibitory genes (TIM-3) compared to circulating T cells. In contrast, intra-tumoral NK cells did not exhibit upregulation of canonical cytotoxic genes (IFNG, GZMB), but rather significant DGE in mitogen signaling (DUSP4) and metabolic function (SMPD3, SLC7A5). Tumors with higher NK and T cell infiltration exhibited significantly increased expression of the pro-inflammatory receptor TLR4 in sorted CD45- tumor cells. TCGA analysis revealed that tumors with high TLR4 expression (P = 0.03) and low expression of STMN1 involved in microtubule polymerization (P {\textless} 0.001) were associated with significantly improved survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Unlike T cells, which demonstrate significant DGE consistent with upregulation of both activating and inhibiting receptors in tumor-infiltrating subsets, NK cells appear to have more stable gene expression between blood and tumor subsets, with alterations restricted primarily to metabolic pathways. Increased immune cell infiltration and improved survival were positively correlated with TLR4 expression and inversely correlated with STMN1 expression within tumors, suggesting possible novel therapeutic targets for immunotherapy in STS.},

	abstract = {Standard statistical practice ignores model uncertainty. Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model averaging (BMA)provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples.In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample predictive performance. We also provide a catalogue of currently available BMA software.},

Here we present a simple workflow using a set of existing R/Bioconductor packages for analysis of DTU. We show how these packages can be used downstream of RNA-seq quantification using the Salmon software package. The entire pipeline is fast, benefiting from inference steps by Salmon to quantify expression at the transcript level. The workflow includes live, runnable code chunks for analysis using DRIMSeq and DEXSeq, as well as for performing two-stage testing of DTU using the stageR package, a statistical framework to screen at the gene level and then confirm which transcripts within the significant genes show evidence of DTU. We evaluate these packages and other related packages on a simulated dataset with parameters estimated from real data.},
